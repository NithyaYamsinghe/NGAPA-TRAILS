## Project Description

### Problem Statement:
In 2023, Greater Darwin welcomed **813,000 overnight visitors**, showing a steady bounce back from the pandemic. Most of these visitors—about **87.6% (713,000 people)**—were Aussies traveling from other parts of the country, with interstate travelers from **New South Wales, Queensland, and Victoria** leading the pack. **International visitors** comprised the rest, accounting for **12.4% (101,000)**.

Interestingly, almost **half of the total visitors were aged 40 and up**. That’s **48% of the market**! Most came for holidays, while others visited for business or to catch up with friends and family.

While the overall numbers dipped slightly from **972,000 the previous year**, this still shows a healthy recovery post-pandemic. The tourism breakdown shows the biggest chunk coming from **domestic travelers**, proving that Aussies still love a good Darwin getaway.

Only **1 in 20 visitors** is involved in **Aboriginal arts and crafts culture**. This presents a great opportunity to increase exposure and promote the rich heritage of Aboriginal arts and crafts.

With so many visitors over **40**, this could be a great chance to lean into marketing Darwin as the perfect relaxing and enriching escape for those seeking a laid-back yet fulfilling holiday experience. Whether it’s the breathtaking landscapes or unique experiences, a well-aimed campaign could resonate with this age group.

### Data Story
The Northern Territory’s tourism strategy is all about giving interstate visitors, especially those aged 40 and up, an unforgettable experience. The plan is to ramp up excitement and engagement with what the region offers by tapping into the communication channels this group loves. Here’s how:

#### Regional Profile Data
**Description of Use:**
The regional profile data was key for us to understand where visitors to the Northern Territory were spending their time and to figure out which spots had the most potential for Aboriginal cultural experiences. This knowledge has underpinned **Ngapa Trails** by ensuring it highlights the right attractions in the areas where visitors are likely to have these unique experiences. By aligning with what is already trending, we can design a platform that truly resonates with the region and the travelers.

#### Northern Territory Data
**Description of Use:**
To know more about Aboriginal culture and its ethnicity, we collected resources from the **Northern Territory** site. Some exclusive information, like the popular local places, accommodations, and ongoing events, has been found there. We use the collective statistics to find a way to enhance their experiences.

### Facebook Group
Setting up a **Facebook group for Aussies 40+** is a smart way to reach this highly engaged audience. Around **65-70%** of them are on Facebook daily, so it’s a perfect spot to connect. The group will let people share travel tips, recommendations, and personal experiences, creating a community vibe.

**Word-of-mouth marketing** will flow naturally, building trust and excitement. The group will also be a great platform for **polls, live chats, and tailored content**, helping to spread the word about hidden gems and must-see spots. Travel guides, tips, and itineraries will be shared, making it easier for members to plan their next trip—and maybe even book one right there.

### Website
The website is where the NT’s unique culture and experiences will shine. Here are the features:

- **Workshops:** Visitors can get hands-on with Australian crafts and culture. From learning local skills to supporting homegrown talent, these workshops will offer a fun and unique way to dive into the NT's traditions.
- **Virtual Tours:** For those who can’t visit in person, virtual tours will showcase the best of the Northern Territory from wherever they are. These will be a great way to spark curiosity and help potential visitors start planning their trip.  
  In our solution, we brought in some **VR magic with Three.js**, to create virtual tours that let people explore Aboriginal cultural sites from anywhere in the world. Imagine diving into 3D environments and spinning around **360-degree views**—all from your browser. It’s like being right there, wandering through these amazing cultural landmarks without leaving your couch. By blending tech with tradition, we’ve made it easy and exciting for anyone to connect with the rich heritage of Aboriginal sites in a whole new way.
- **Guided Tours:** The site will highlight **local guided tours** led by experts who know all the best spots—hidden gems that tourists might not find on their own. These tours promise a deep, immersive dive into the local culture.
- **Marketplace for Aboriginal Art and Crafts:** An online marketplace will feature authentic Aboriginal art and crafts, allowing visitors to take home something special while supporting local artists. This isn’t just about buying souvenirs—it’s about **celebrating and preserving Aboriginal cultural heritage**.
- **AI Voice Assistant:** The AI voice assistant for the Ngapa Trails website enhances the user experience by allowing voice-based navigation using **Google Dialogflow** and speech recognition technologies. Users can activate the assistant via a microphone icon, give voice commands, and navigate the site effortlessly. The system processes voice inputs, converts them to text, and detects the user’s intent (e.g., "Show me virtual tours") using Dialogflow’s natural language processing capabilities. This feature provides a hands-free, accessible, and intuitive way for users to interact with the site, improving overall usability and inclusivity.

All these elements work together to make the Northern Territory not just a place to visit but an experience that resonates with visitors, especially those 40 and up.
